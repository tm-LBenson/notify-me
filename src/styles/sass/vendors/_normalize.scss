/*To use the normalize.scss you need to first run `npm i normalize.css` */

// Import normalize.css

// @import '../node_modules/normalize.css/normalize';

/* Normalize.css is a modern alternative to CSS resets.
   It provides a set of styles that help browsers render elements consistently
   and in line with modern web standards. It is a popular choice for projects
   that aim for cross-browser consistency, and can be used instead of a CSS reset.

   If you're already using a CSS reset, consider removing it before using
   normalize.css, as they serve similar purposes and it's generally not
   necessary to use both.

   After running `npm i normalize.css`, uncomment the line above to import
   normalize.css from your node_modules directory.

   The imported normalize.css styles will then be included in your compiled
   CSS file, so you don't need to add any additional link tags to your HTML.

   If you want to customize normalize.css or include only specific parts of it,
   you can copy the necessary parts from the original file and include them
   in your SCSS project.
