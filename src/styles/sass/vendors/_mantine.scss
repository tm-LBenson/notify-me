/* 
To use Mantine components and customize their styles, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary Mantine packages:
   npm i @mantine/core
   npm i @mantine/hooks

2. Locate the component's SCSS file in the node_modules/@mantine/core/src directory.

3. Import the component's SCSS file into your project's SCSS files.

4. Override the default variables or add your own custom styles for the component.

Example: Customize the Button component
*/

// Step 2: Locate the Button component's SCSS file
// The file is located at node_modules/@mantine/core/src/components/Button/Button.scss

// Step 3: Import the Button component's SCSS file into your project's SCSS files
//@import '../node_modules/@mantine/core/src/components/Button/Button';

// Step 4: Override the default variables or add your own custom styles for the Button component
$button-primary-color: #f06c9b;
$button-primary-background-color: #1d1f2f;

.Button {
  border-radius: 8px;

  &--hover {
    transform: translateY(-2px);
  }
}

/* 
Remember to compile your SCSS files into CSS and include the compiled CSS file in your project.
Please note that customizing Mantine components' styles using SCSS is an advanced technique, 
and it's not the primary way of styling Mantine components. Mantine provides a built-in theming 
system that allows you to customize the appearance of your components more easily. You can learn 
more about Mantine's theming system in their official documentation:
